Learning Rust

## Some notes

- `rust files` always ends with `.rs` estensions.
- The `main` function is always the first to be executed.
- rust idents with four spaces not tab.
- `!` after a name, like `println!` indicates that a macro is being called.
- `Cargo` is rust build system and package manager. In a project, handles things like building and maintaining the dependencies in order.
